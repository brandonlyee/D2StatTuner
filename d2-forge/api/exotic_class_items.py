Exotic Class Item Perk Combinations

This file contains all known and potential exotic class item perk combinations.
Map format: (perk1, perk2) -> (primary_stat, secondary_stat, tertiary_stat)

Validated combinations are uncommented and actively used by the optimizer.
Commented combinations marked "# Guess, needs validation" are potential future additions
that require in-game verification of their stat distributions.
